                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666; text-align: center;">Beloved ONE|Local Producers,</p>
                
                <h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #333333; text-align: center;">A New Era of Connection and Purpose</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666; text-align: center;">We're on the cusp of something extraordinary. The rebirth of the ONE|Local app is underway and it is more than just an upgrade—it's an invitation to continue with a movement that prioritizes connection over competition, community over isolation, and shared purpose over individual ambition. We're stepping into a future where the richness of our connections and the depth of our shared experiences define us.</p>
                
                <h4 style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333; text-align: center;">What's New and What to Expect:</h4>
                <ul style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666; text-align: center;">
                    <li>The rebuild has begun to release in test mode to about 10% of your devices. If that is the case for you, please play with the functionality there and reply to this email with any feedback you may have.</li>
                    <li>There are still some UI bugs to iron out and features to finalize, but rest assured, everything related to events, ticketing, and payouts is fully functioning and will operate just as it did before.</li>
                    <li>While in this transition phase: engage with live events and ticketing using the web app at <a href="https://app.oneboulder.one" style="color: #6F1111; text-decoration: underline;">https://app.oneboulder.one</a>, until Monday. Full migration to the production server will happen early Monday morning.</li>
                    <li>Your insights are most valuable to us as we work towards creating a seamless and user-friendly experience. Thank you for being an integral part of this journey and for your patience as we make these improvements.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666; text-align: center;">The rebuild of ONE|Boulder to ONE|Local will contain all the features you’ve grown to know and love within the ONE|Boulder app, and will be expanding into new frontiers for community resource sharing and collaborative coordination for all kinds of projects, events and co-creations. For more details on what’s to come please read further.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #333333; text-align: center;">Our Vision for the Future:</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666; text-align: center;">There is something truly revolutionary unfolding, and your role at this point in this journey is crucial. As the world around us revolves and evolves, so does the ONE|Local app—transforming into a vibrant social coordination platform that will empower us to deepen our engagement in the community we cherish.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666; text-align: center;">ONE|Boulder and ONE|Local have always been meant to serve as a “weaving” function in the world. Yes, the world. Though we began local, in Boulder, where this collective-vision was birthed, the vision extends beyond Boulder to our National and Global communities. We dream for our global village to be woven, and to support the interconnectedness of like-minded soulcentric and ecocentric communities to have an easier way to stay connected and share resources, services and events, as well as to have a tool to coordinate more efficiently, within their local regions, and beyond.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666; text-align: center;">We are going beyond. ONE|Boulder is the first branch of many to come in the ONE|Local global tree. Yes, we are growing. And, with the expansion, we are also enhancing our collective ability to manage projects, events, and organizations, as well as broadening our cultural horizon to embrace more family-oriented events. We are here for integration and collective maturation, for the diversity of experiences and opportunities that are necessary for a whole and well ecosystem of humans to thrive in body, heart and soul.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666; text-align: center;">This change is a testament to our collective growth and the maturation of our co-created vision. We have always been destined for more than just being another event or social platform. The ONE|Local app serves as a mycelial technology to support in the resources sharing between local communities, in order to provide one another with what we desire and need within our local bioregion, to become collectively sovereign. Thus, the app’s evolution is on its way to becoming the coordination tool it has always been meant to be.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666; text-align: center;">We want to imprint this platform with a new sense of our cultural interconnectedness. We want to showcase the powerful already-existing happenings within different bioregions and hold space for the raising of novel cultures with depth and coherence.</p>
