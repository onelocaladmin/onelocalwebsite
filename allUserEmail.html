                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">Beloved ONE|Local Producers,</p>
                
                <h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #333333;">A New Era of Connection and Purpose</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">We're on the cusp of something extraordinary. The rebirth of the ONE|Local app is more than an upgrade—it's an invitation to join a movement that prioritizes connection over competition, community over isolation, and shared purpose over individual ambition. We're stepping into a future where the richness of our connections and the depth of our shared experiences define us.</p>
                
                <h4 style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333;">What's New and What to Expect:</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">The rebuild has begun to release in test mode to about 10% of your devices. If that is the case for you, please play with the functionality there and reply to this email with any feedback you may have.<br>
                There are still some UI bugs to iron out and features to finalize, but rest assured, everything related to events, ticketing, and payouts is fully functioning and will operate just as it did before.<br>
                While in this transition phase: To engage with live events and ticketing, full migration to the production server will happen early Monday morning. Meanwhile, if your app has updated, please engage with live events and ticketing using the web app at <a href="https://app.oneboulder.one" style="color: #6F1111;">https://app.oneboulder.one</a>, until Monday.<br>
                Your insights are most valuable to us as we work towards creating a seamless and user-friendly experience. Thank you for being an integral part of this journey and for your patience as we make these improvements.</p>
                
                <h4 style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333;">Our Vision for the Future:</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">We are on the brink of something truly revolutionary, and your role at this point in this journey is crucial. As the world around us revolves and evolves, so does the ONE|Local app—transforming into a vibrant social coordination platform that will empower us to deepen our engagement in the community we cherish.<br>
                ONE|Boulder is the first branch of many to come in the ONE|Local global tree. Yes, we are growing. With the expansion, we are enhancing our collective ability to manage projects, events, and organizations, and broadening our cultural horizon to embrace more family-oriented events.<br>
                We want to imprint this platform with a new sense of our cultural interconnectedness. We want to showcase the powerful existing cultures of every homeland and hold space for the raising of novel cultures with depth and coherence.</p>
                
                <h4 style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333;">Join Us in Building a Better World:</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">Imagine a world where every contribution is valued, where every skill and resource can find its perfect match. That's the future we're building with ONE|Local. Whether it’s sharing a skill, organizing an event, or connecting over shared values, the new ONE|Local app is designed to make these exchanges seamless and rewarding.<br>
                Our main reason for rebuilding was to have a widely understood framework that will be far more agile to rapidly fix bugs and develop the feature sets you request! Rest assured, everything related to events, ticketing, and payouts is fully functioning and will operate just as it did before.<br>
                It might not be perfect at first, but the new foundation will support the emergence of what the community needs. Although we have a vision for where this technology is headed, it is your feedback that will continue to shape the app and the tools that we continue to build.<br>
                We’re introducing features that allow you to create and manage organizations, groups, projects, roles, and tasks with ease, ensuring that you can find or offer the perfect skill or resource for any need.</p>
                
                <h4 style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333;">Your Contribution Matters:</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">We understand that the road has been rocky. It’s not easy creating something the world has never seen before. Governance is hard. Working collaboratively is hard. But through every trial and triumph, your steadfast dedication as Producers has been the anchor that has kept our dreams afloat.</p>
                
                <h4 style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333;">Let's Shape Our Future Together:</h4>
