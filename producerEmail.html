                <h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: #333333;">Dear ONE|Local Family,</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">We are on the brink of something truly revolutionary, and your role at this point in this journey is crucial. As the world around us revolves and evolves, so does the ONE|Local app — transforming into a vibrant social coordination platform that will empower us to deepen our engagement in the community we cherish, a testament to our collective growth and the maturation of our co-created vision. This upgrade will, yes, bless us with a new look, but it is so much more than that.</p>
                
                <h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #333333;">A Movement Towards Integration and Collective Maturation</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">ONE|Boulder has been the seed, and will remain among the many branches on the ONE|Local olive tree. Yes, we are growing. And with the expansion, we are also enhancing our collective ability to manage projects, events, and organizations, and broadening our cultural horizon to embrace more family-oriented events. We are here for integration and collective maturation. For the diversity of experiences and opportunities that are necessary for a whole and well ecosystem of humans to thrive in body, heart and soul. We want to imprint this platform with the engram of a new sense of cultural interconnectedness. We want to showcase the powerful existing cultures of every homeland where they exist, and where they may have been lost, we want to hold space for the raising of novel cultures with depth and coherence, connected with the earth, and the cycle of life, and in relationship to every source of human nourishment like food, family and friends, and a sense purpose and belonging. We want to be in a shared context where the world makes sense, where we hold roles we’re proud of, where we share the way, and feel welcomed and at home in the world.</p>
                
                <h4 style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333;">Imagine a World of Valued Contributions and Seamless Exchanges</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">Imagine a world where every contribution is valued, where every skill and resource can find its perfect match. That's the future we're building with ONE|Local. Whether it’s sharing a skill, organizing an event, or connecting over shared values, the new ONE|Local app is designed to make these exchanges seamless and rewarding. We’re introducing features that allow you to create and manage organizations, groups, projects, roles, and tasks with ease, ensuring that you can find or offer the perfect skill or resource for any need. This means more visibility for your events, more support for your projects, and a stronger community fabric woven through shared purpose and mutual support.</p>
                
                <h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #333333;">Join Us in Leading a Cultural Shift</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">This is more than just an app. ONE|Local is a movement towards a world where every interaction enriches our community, where every exchange strengthens our bonds, where every connection increases our capacity to love and be loved. By choosing to engage, to share, and to support within ONE|Local, you're not just participating in a platform; you're leading a cultural shift towards a more connected, resilient, and vibrant community. We’re inspired by the potential that lies in collaboration, not competition. Together, we're not just making Boulder a better place; we're setting a precedent for how communities around the world can thrive through genuine, heartfelt cooperation.</p>
                
                <h4 style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333;">Your Contribution Matters</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">We understand that the road has been rocky. It’s not easy creating something the world has never seen before. Governance is hard. Working collaboratively is hard. Sometimes we need to go through the mud to learn what works and what doesn’t. The essence of our journey is encapsulated in the collective spirit and contributions of each one of you who has infused this space with your unique gifts and offerings over the past four years. Through every trial and triumph, your steadfast dedication as Producers has been the anchor that has kept our dreams afloat. Through the thickets and thorns, the waterfalls and blossoms, we are humbled and grateful. We are excited. The organization is changing, but the earliest stewards are still here, after all these years, patiently keeping the fire of a prayer alive and tending to its flames even in ashes, even after all the storms, even when you questioned if there would be anything left at all.</p>
                
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">And throughout this whole dance, You have been here. As a Producer you have held such a strong anchor in keeping this space alive for the weaving of dreams, thank you! Thank you for being a cornerstone of this journey.</p>
                
                <h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #333333;">Join Us in Shaping the Future</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666666;">We're excited to embark on this next chapter with you, to see how our collective creativity and commitment can shape a more beautiful world. How you share your voice, your vision, and your vitality is what will make this dream a reality. Expressing ourselves and receiving each other's’ true gifts has always been the heart of our prayer. Building the world better together - with care. Please bear with us as we roll out this rebuild which is fully functional but may be rocky with some bugs in the first couple weeks. Our new react-native and node.js codebase will be far more agile to rapidly fix bugs and develop the feature sets you request! Please reply to this email! We’d love to hear from you with encouragement, questions, suggestions, complaints, support or connection of any kind. Let's show the world what we can achieve together.</p>
