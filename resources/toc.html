<h2>Introduction: The Metaphor of the Tree</h2>
<p>In a storm-tossed sea of the contemporary mythic flood, a tree rises, its heartbeat sending waves of peace into the surrounding ocean, defying the surging tides. This tree is a beacon of hope, resilience, and interconnectedness, standing tall with roots entwined in the human spirit and ecological balance, offering shelter to all who seek it in a world threatened by disconnection.</p>

<h2>ONE Local: A Member-Governed Platform</h2>
<p>ONE Local is a member-governed platform for social coordination, with voting members of various classes who can offer or request skills and services, send "gratis" points, create projects and events, and delineate groups, roles, and tasks. The goal is streamlined intent matching, relating our work to a shared mythic purpose, and orienting ourselves as one human family.</p>

<h2>Our Mission and Values</h2>
<p>We are agents optimizing culture and civilization for the most gratifying experience possible, balanced with healthy ecosystems and creative innovation. As crises converge, we must recohere a life-affirming shared meaning, acknowledging our interconnectedness and moving beyond self-serving ambition.</p>

<h2>The Role of AI and Human Experience</h2>
